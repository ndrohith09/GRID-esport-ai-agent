**AGENT RESPONSE**: **Player: aspas (Round 1)**  

**Combat & Efficiency**
- **Damage efficiency:** Very low (shap –4.405) → poor conversion of damage into round impact.  
- **Headshot/body ratio:** Negative contribution → aim precision below expected duelist level.  
- **Win probability:** Only ≈ 4.9 % → low clutch and duel success.

**Weapon & Playstyle**
- **Rifle‑heavy:** ≈ 65 % of damage from rifles (mainly Phantom). Predictable and economy‑sensitive.  
- **Weapon entropy:** Low → opponents can anticipate rifle duels.  
- **Utility use:** Minimal (mostly Boom Bot). Paint Shells and Satchels underused.

**Risk Profile**
- **Self‑damage:** High, likely from Raze abilities → reduces survivability and clutch potential.

**Actionable Feedback**
- Refine satchel entries to avoid self‑damage.  
- Broaden ability usage for space creation and pressure.  
- Add weapon variety (Spectre/Sheriff) to raise unpredictability.  
- Drill precision and damage‑to‑kill conversion.  
- Manage economy—avoid full‑spend every round.

**Summary:**  
Aspas played as a high‑risk rifler with low efficiency and predictable patterns. Improving precision, ability 
balance, and economic discipline will significantly raise round impact.

**AGENT RESPONSE**: 

### Game Review Agenda – Player: aspas (Series 2819695, Round 1)

**1. Player Overview**  
- Role: Duelist (Raze recommended)  
- Style: Aim‑heavy rifler, minimal utility use  
- Win probability: ≈ 5 % → low round impact  

**2. Combat Metrics**  
- Primary weapon: Phantom (≈ 55 % of damage)  
- Body damage: ≈ 54 % → spray‑control reliance  
- Head damage: ≈ 48 % → decent precision, inconsistent conversion  
- Issues: low damage efficiency, early deaths  

**3. Weapon Entropy & Dependency**  
- Low entropy → predictable rifle use (Phantom/Vandal ≈ 77 %)  
- High dependency → large credit spend, poor eco performance  

**4. Ability & Utility Usage**  
- Boom Bot: 100 % usage  
- Paint Shells / Blast Pack / Showstopper: underused  
- Note: self‑damage suggests unsafe satchel or nade timing  

**5. Objective Contribution**  
- Strong orb control (5 captures, high suitability)  
- Weak bomb‑related impact (plants/defuses low)  

**6. Tactical Recommendations**  
1. Diversify weapons to reduce predictability.  
2. Drill headshot conversion; limit body‑spray reliance.  
3. Refine Raze utility timing and positioning.  
4. Manage economy—avoid unnecessary full buys.  
5. Improve post‑entry survivability.  

**7. Review Session Plan**

| Segment | Focus | Duration |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Combat Review | Aim patterns, kill efficiency | 20 min |
| Utility Audit | Ability usage & self‑damage | 15 min |
| Economy Management | Buy patterns & eco impact | 10 min |
| Objective Review | Orb control vs. site impact | 10 min |
| Tactical Adjustments | Weapon diversity & positioning | 15 min |

**Summary:**  
Aspas demonstrates solid mechanics but predictable weapon use and inefficient damage conversion. Emphasize utility 
optimization, economic discipline, and adaptive weapon choices to raise round impact and consistency.
